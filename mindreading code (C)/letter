Here is the uuencode'd compress'd tar'd source code. 

Save this message, uudecode, uncompress and untar. 
Then type "make race" to compile.B  The executable will be called 
"race".B  The instructions are pretty self-explanatory. 

All games will be archived in <compile-dir>/archive, where 
<compile-dir> is the directory in which the code was compiled. 
To change this directory, see the documentation in the makefile. 

If you want to run with Hagelbarger's algorithm, in the makefile, 
change 

B  EXPERT_LIST = var_tree_exp_sym_py, var_tree_exp_sym_y 
B  EXPERT_FILES_o = var_tree_exp_sym_py.o var_tree_exp_sym_y.o dutch_trees.o 

to 

B  EXPERT_LIST = hagelbarger_exp 
B  EXPERT_FILES_o = hagelbarger.o 

and re-make.B  (I realize this is really clunky.) 

Probably best not to distribute this source code. 



exp.tar.Z B
