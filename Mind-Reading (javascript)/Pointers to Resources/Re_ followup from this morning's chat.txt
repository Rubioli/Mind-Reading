hi yoav,

there are a lot of jquery and d3 tutorials out there. i don’t remember which, if any, i fully went through, but here are some suggestions.

i like interactive tutorials for these things. try:

	http://try.jquery.com
	http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery
	https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery

this site has a generally useful and concise set of tutorials for html, css, and jquery:
	
	http://learn.shayhowe.com

i would keep it minimal in terms of how deep to go into this. jquery is basically useful for selecting and modifying DOM elements, interacting with a server using ajax calls, and adding interaction in the form of click/hover/etc events.

it seems like more of what you want is to easily draw on SVG canvases. d3 is great for this. here’s a very simple intro:

and here is a long list and book:

	https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials
	https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks

more to the point, here is a simple example of code to draw circles on a mouse click. (this is something the adaboost demo needs, right? i can’t get the java applet to run on my machine, sadly.)

jsfiddle is generally useful in that you can edit and execute code in the browser and see the results immediately, btw.

and as for your question of responsiveness, here is a game written in d3:

it’s pretty quick for me, although i had a little trouble using it on my iphone.

as i mentioned, this simple project has many of the elements you’re interested in, with minimal other stuff:

	http://jhofman.github.io/flights/

it uses jquery, d3, and some css (bootstrap) to make things desktop and mobile friendly.

the core javascript running everything is here:

	https://github.com/jhofman/flights/blob/gh-pages/js/flights.jsi

it uses the d3.csv function to grab data from a server file, parses it into the proper data structures, and then uses d3 to draw a bar chart. jquery extensions handle autocomplete and other functions.

if you want to log back to a server, you would use the ajax call in jquery and create a server-side script to receive the call and write to a database. php is usually an easy option, although mongo could be good too. i’d think node.js is overkill, but i’ve never actually written anything with it.

by the way, pretty much everything i know about is bookmarked on my delicious page, easily navigable by tags. so, for instance, here are those frameworks i mentioned to build mobile apps using html/css/javascript:

	https://delicious.com/jhofman/mobile,javascript

happy to spend an hour in person talking about all this if that would be useful. it would probably lessen the learning curve.

best,
jake

Hi Jake,

My first goal is to recreate my adaboost applet and the mind-reading applet using javascript. Do you think that D3 is the best platform for this or would I be better off using something like jcanvas: http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/
or jquery-svg: http://keith-wood.name/svg.html

In any case, please point me to good jQuery and D3 tutorials.

Yoav

thanks for the pointers on dc.js and crossfilter. happy to recommend some d3 and jquery references, if that’s useful. just let me know.

best,
jake
